| OLOUD-BASE    | Ontology for Linked Open University Data                 | The objectives of the OLOUD ontology is to support the development and   publishing of Linked Open University Datasets and the applications built on   the top of these Open Datasets. OLOUD contains classes and properties to   describe Organizations, People, their Roles and Publications, Subjects,   Courses and other Events and their temporal and spatial description. The   ontology is divided into two connected modules: 1. OLOUD-BASE is the main   module describing all the university related concepts and uses the prefix   oloud, 2. OLOUD-LOC module provides the indoor location and navigation   features and uses the prefix loc. |
