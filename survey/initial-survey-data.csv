http://purl.org/spar/fabio	https://github.com/SPAROntologies/fabio	FaBiO	FRBR-aligned Bibliographic Ontology	FaBiO is an ontology for describing entities that are published or potentially publishable (such as journal articles, conference papers, books), and that contain or are referred to by bibliographic references. It also includes blogs, web pages, data sets, computer algorithms, experimental protocols, formal specifications and vocabularies, legal records, governmental papers, technical and commercial reports, and similar publications, and also anthologies, catalogs, and similar collections. FaBiO has been developed so to limit any restriction to its classes also because of the domains and ranges of its properties. FaBiO has flexibility and it has a good advantage of allowing FaBiO to be used alongside other models.
http://purl.org/spar/cito	https://github.com/SPAROntologies/cito	CiTO	Citation Typing Ontology	CiTO is an ontology that permits characterization of the character or sort of citations, both factually and rhetorically. Properties (and, consequently, their inverses) could also be classified as rhetorical and/or factual, with the rhetorical properties being grouped in three sets counting on their connotation: positive, informative (neutral) or negative. For the domain and range constraints from the thing, properties aren't defined, in order that this ontology might be easily integrated with other models, such as FaBiO. Two other ontologies are defined for explicitly describing specific aspects of CiTO. The primary one is named Functions of Citations Ontology (FOCO) and therefore the other called CiTO to Wordnet Ontology (C2W).
http://purl.org/spar/biro	https://github.com/SPAROntologies/biro	BiRO	Bibliographic Reference Ontology	BiRO is an ontology meant to define bibliographic records, bibliographic references, and their compilation into bibliographic collections and bibliographic lists, respectively. It uses an OWL-based definition of the FRBR model to define bibliographic references and their compilation into ordered bibliographic lists, by means of the Collections Ontology.
http://purl.org/spar/c4o	https://github.com/SPAROntologies/c4oo	C4O	Citation Counting and Context Characterisation Ontology	C4O is an ontology that allows the amount of in-text citations of a cited source to be recorded, alongside their textual citation contexts, alongside the number of citations a cited entity has received globally on a specific date. it's also useful to explain how these references are utilized in the citing paper. C4O also provides the ontological structures which permit one to record the amount of in-text citations like, the amount of in-text reference tips that could one reference within the reference list of the citing article.
http://purl.org/spar/doco	https://github.com/SPAROntologies/doco	DoCO	Document Components Ontology	DoCO is an ontology that gives a structured vocabulary written of document components, both structural (such as, block, inline, paragraph, section, chapter) and rhetorical (such as, introduction, discussion, acknowledgments, reference list, figure, appendix). It imports the Pattern Ontology that describes structural patterns, and therefore the Discourse Element Ontology (DEO), which was developed with DoCO and describes rhetorical components. It also defines hybrid classes describing elements that are both structural and rhetorical in nature, like paragraph, section, or list. DoCO is additionally aligned with the SALT Rhetorical Ontology and therefore the Ontology of Rhetorical Blocks (ORB).
http://purl.org/spar/pso	https://github.com/SPAROntologies/pso	PSO	Publishing Status Ontology	PSO is an ontology designed to characterize the publication status of documents at each stage of the publishing process (such as draft, submitted, under review, etc.). Documents can hold a specific status at a specific time as an immediate consequence of a particular event. Pre Existing ontologies describing the status of documents (such as, BIBO, the Project Documents Ontology, and therefore the Document Status Ontology), relay for this on specific property links but this approach prevents a correct description of scenarios that need a temporal duration for every status. it's been developed so as to deal with these issues in a more satisfactory manner. With PRO, PSO was developed following the TVC pattern, such as, a model for describing scenarios during which something has value during a specific time and for a specific context. 
http://purl.org/spar/pro	https://github.com/SPAROntologies/pro	PRO	Publishing Roles Ontology	PRO is an ontology for the characterization of the roles of agents – people, corporate bodies, and computational agents within the publication process. These agents are often, authors, editors, reviewers, publishers, or librarians. Define publishing roles is crucial for providing an entire description of a scholarly resource like a paper or a dataset. Using TVC pattern, a model for describing scenarios during which something has value during a specific time and for a specific context because the basis, they need to implement PRO, the Publishing Roles Ontology.
http://purl.org/spar/pwo	https://github.com/SPAROntologies/pwo	PWO	Publishing Workflow Ontology	PWO, a simple ontology for describing the steps of the workflow related to the publication of a document or other publication entity. PWO supported two main classes called Workflow and Step.

http://purl.org/cerif/frapo/	https://github.com/SPAROntologies/frapo	FRAPO	Funding, Research Administration and Projects Ontology	FRAPO is that the Funding, Research Administration and Projects Ontology, which may be a CERIF-compliant ontology for describing administrative information concerning grant funding and research projects. It is often used for the characterization of grant applications, funding bodies, research projects, project partners, etc., in other words, the type of data stored in Current Research Information Systems (CRIS). It also can be wont to describe other sorts of projects, for instance, building projects and academic projects. It also imports FOAF for characterizing people.
http://purl.org/spar/datacite	https://sparontologies.github.io/datacite/current/datacite.html	DO	DataCite Ontology	The main intent of the DataCite Ontology is to supply a versatile mechanism to define the identifier for bibliographic resources (papers and datasets) and related entities. it's also possible to supply a link between a resource, like a dataset, and therefore the document describing its metadata by means of CiTO, using the property citesAsMetadataDocument, and FaBiO, by means of the category MetadataDocument. additionally, to those entities, the DataCite Ontology provides appropriate classes and properties to specify the actual scheme followed for creating the resource metadata exemplified within the metadata document.
http://purl.org/spar/bido	https://sparontologies.github.io/bido/current/bido.html	BiDO	Bibliometric Data Ontology	BiDO developed a well-known model for enabling the classification of authors and journals consistent with bibliometric data is crucial to permit one to question, share and reuse such data during a different context, for example, for providing smart visualization of bibliometric data for sense-making activities and for enabling automatic reasoning on them. The core module of the ontology allows us to explain any entity and therefore the related bibliometric data at a particular time and consistent with a particular agent. BiDO consists of three different modules and people are Standard bibliometric measures, Research career categories, and Review measures.
