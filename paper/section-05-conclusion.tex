\label{section:5}

The presented research adds to the current vivid motion around scholarly KGs the perspective of a wider scope of (senior) researcher daily activities as well as that of ontology reuse.
The comparison between a model extracted from a collection of researcher information needs and KG competence questions on one side and existing ontologies on the other side reveals that in many areas a huge number of models overlap while some others are nearly untouched.

The presented survey focused on ontologies alone.
The most imminent future work then consists in extending the survey, in an integrated manner, to actual KGs as well as to existing thesauri. 
Although any   ontology can be reused in the future, their actual usage in datasets may vary; this represents another dimension that could be added to our analysis.
We have been collecting, in parallel, links to scholarly KGs, roughly partitioned according to the concepts from the model presented in this paper.
